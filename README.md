 Canny Edge Detection

This project demonstrates the Canny Edge Detection algorithm — a powerful technique used in image processing to detect edges in digital images.

## 📌 What is Canny Edge Detection?

Canny Edge Detection is a multi-stage algorithm developed by John F. Canny in 1986. It aims to detect a wide range of edges in images by:

1. **Noise Reduction**: Applying Gaussian blur to smooth the image.
2. **Gradient Calculation**: Finding intensity gradients using Sobel filters.
3. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Thinning edges to retain only the sharpest ones.
4. **Double Thresholding**: Classifying edges as strong, weak, or irrelevant.
5. **Edge Tracking by Hysteresis**: Finalizing edges by connecting strong
